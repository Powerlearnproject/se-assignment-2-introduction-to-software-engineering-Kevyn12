# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
This is the application of engineering principles, methords  and tools to the development and mentainanceof software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Software development life cycle has four phases that are
Requirements- This is bringing together all the documents and files thatthe user would need and system need.
Design- this is creating high level and detailed designs for software user interface and its architecture.
Implementation- This is coding and creating a software according to its design specification. 
Testing -  This is doing various tests to ensure the software created meets required quality standards.
Deployment- This is releasing software to the users or customers .
Mentainance- Thos is providing on going updates and changes to the software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
This are development methodologies that are used to guide software development process
Waterfall this is a sequential approach that has distinct phases that flow down like a watfall while agile on the other hand uses an iterative and incremental approach that focuses on felixility, collaboration and responding to change on the project.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requiremet engineering is a process in the software development lifecycle that involes gathering of all tools and files that will be needed at verious areas during design of a software.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit resting- This is testing diffrent parts of a software.
Intergration testing- This is testing about how diffrent software components and subsystems interact 
System testing- This is testing of softwre as a whole.
Acceptance testing- This is testing of a software with regards to user demands to find if it meets required user demands.
Software testing is important because it helps out identifty and fix defects early in the development process.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

A software project manager oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects
Some of the challanges that might be experienced by a softwatre project manager include:
Tight deadlines- Pressure to have projects completed on a short timeframe  can lead to compromising of product quality.
Changing of requirements- Project requirements may change during development process that may affect project delays.
Technical dept- This may be caused by shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, this may affect future development and also increase mentainance cost.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software  mentainance is the process of providing ongoing  updates and support and making enhancements to the software after deployment.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
